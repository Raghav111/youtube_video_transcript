# youtube_video_transcript

I sometimes need the content of a youtube video. Mainly education video, I like to add them to my notes, blog post I usually make. The best way to get the content was from the subtitles. 

I was initially using the youtube api. But I found this - http://stackoverflow.com/a/21550325. So it gets the job done without getting into youtube developers api which can be difficult for such a small task.

I can make a front-end for this if get time otherwise it gets my job done. 

Just do this - 

`npm install`

`node app.js`
