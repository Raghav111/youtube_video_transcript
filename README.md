# Youtube Transcripter

Just a hobby project I made to fetch the transcript of educational youtube videos I watched. It is easy to fetch and edit the content rather than noting it down. 

Built with Express 4. 

**To run locally**

1.`npm install`

2.`npm start`

There were few new things I learned while making this.

* Body Parser Working - I forgot to attach body-parser module, eventually I ended up [here](https://medium.com/@adamzerner/how-bodyparser-works-247897a93b90). Brushed up my fundamentals on this. 
* Heruko Deployment - Deployed to heruko for the very first time using just CLI. Read [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git)
